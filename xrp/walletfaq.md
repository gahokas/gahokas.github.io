# XRP Beginner Wallet FAQ

As a fairly new investor in XRP, I was horribly confused by wallets, how they work, and the best practices for using them. This is intended for retail investors of XRP with some general knowledge of cryptocurrencies who want to know more details of how XRP wallets work.

Have more questions? Let me know!

### What is an address?
An address refers to an account on the public XRP ledger. Addresses look like 
```

```
You can think of an address as your account number on the public XRP ledger. Associated with your address on the public XRP ledger is how many XRP you own.

### What is a secret?
A secret is your “password” for your address, that allows you to create transactions (ie send XRP) from your address to another address. It is critical that you keep your secret safe and don’t lose it. Anyone who knows your secret can take all of your XRP. If you lose your secret, it is impossible to recover, and it is impossible to send XRP from your address. Your XRP will be stuck forever at your address, and you won’t be able to send or sell them.

Typically secrets look like:

Secrets can also come in a few different formats, such as a series of letters or numbers.

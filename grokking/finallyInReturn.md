# Telephonic round 19) Can we have return statement in finally clause? What will happen?

This is an interesting question. I don't think I've ever attempted to put a return statement inside a finally block in my professional coding career. Typically finally blocks are used as clean up code from previous try blocks, and I would put any return statement at the end of the method.  However there are a couple of interesting learnings from attempting it. Suppose we have the following code:

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        String result = calculate();
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);      
    }

    public static String calculate() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Calculating...");
            int result = 1 + 2 + 3;
            return "Answer: " + result;            
        }
        finally {
            System.out.println("In finally");
            return "Return from finally";
        }
        
    }
}
```

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

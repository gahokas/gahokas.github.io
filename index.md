### Grokking the Java Interview

[Javin Paul's](https://twitter.com/javinpaul) book [Grokking the Java Interview](https://gumroad.com/l/QqjGH) is an excellent, broad range of Java-based topics that any programmer preparing for an interview, or wanting to brush up on their Java skills, should pick up. Below are some of the questions I found tricky along with some sample code as I investigated the answers.

#### Telephonic round
